## Short description of the idea
Draw and guess is an app where you can challenge Neural Network-based AI to a charade game. 
You can either choose random item and try to draw it and watch AI try to guess what you're drawing
or let AI draw randomly chosen item and guess what it is supposed to be.

The project will be either Django web app or standalone app (we did not decide yet),
and we will try to use the largest database of handdrawn pictures - the [Google's Quick Draw](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset).
