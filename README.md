### Do you need more people: Maybe

## Short description of the idea
Drawuess is an app where you can challenge Neural Network to a charade game. 
Get random word, try to draw a picture of it and let AI guess what you are drawing.

The extended part of the project is a game mode, where user has to guess what is displayed on images shown and try to draw it,
then user can ask AI what they have drawn and check wheter what they thought and what AI thinks is the same.

The project will be Django web app, and we will try to use the largest database of handdrawn pictures - the [Google's Quick Draw](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset).
