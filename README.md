## Short description of the idea
Drawuess is an app where you can challenge Neural Network to a charade game. 
Get random word, try to draw a picture of it and let NN guess what you are drawing.

We expect to add more features but this is the core of the project.

The project will be Django web app, and we will try to use the largest database of handdrawn pictures - the [Google's Quick Draw](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset).
